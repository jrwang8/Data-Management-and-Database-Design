# Data-Management-and-Database-Design
This project is for the assignments of DMDD by Prof. Nic Brown.

The title and the requirements are stated as below:
Gathering, Scraping, Munging and Cleaning Data
In this assignment, you will be gathering real-world data. This process is often called data munging or
data wrangling. All of your database tables must be populated with real-world data. Any substitution of
simulated data for real-world data must be pre-approved by the TAs.
This assignment can be done in pairs, or individually.

The process is as follows:

You must find sources of data. (This can be downloads, XML files, JSON, HTML pages, data repositories,
etc.) The data must have a thematic relation (e.g. all NBA data, all job data, etc.) (30 points)
There must be three sources:
    1. A web scraper
    2. A web API
    3. Raw text, csv, xml, or excel data

You must create a conceptual database schema (10 points)

You must download and reformat the data to fit a conceptual database schema. (This involves using web
scrapers, web API’s, formatting scripts, parsing files, etc.) (10 points)

You must audit the quality and estimate the amount of data you’ll gather. This involves auditing (i.e.
testing to evaluate quality/accuracy - a systematic and independent examination of data). You will need
to audit the following:
Audit (10 points)
    • Audit Validity/ Accuracy
    • Audit Completeness
    • Audit Consistency/Uniformity 

You must clean the data or show that it doesn’t need cleaning (10 points)
Write a report explaining all of the files, the tests and their results and code. (30 points)
Professionalism (10 points)
    • Consistent Naming Scheme
    • Commenting & Documentation
    • File and Folder Organization
    • Separation of Code and Data
    • Use Efficient Data Structures and Algorithms
    • Keep Your Code Portable
