#The title and the requirements are stated as below:<br/> 
Gathering, Scraping, Munging and Cleaning Data<br/>
In this assignment, you will be gathering real-world data. This process is often called data munging or
data wrangling. All of your database tables must be populated with real-world data. Any substitution of
simulated data for real-world data must be pre-approved by the TAs.
This assignment can be done in pairs, or individually.

The process is as follows:

You must find sources of data. (This can be downloads, XML files, JSON, HTML pages, data repositories,
etc.) The data must have a thematic relation (e.g. all NBA data, all job data, etc.) (30 points)
There must be three sources:<br/> 1. A web scraper<br/>2. A web API<br/>3. Raw text, csv, xml, or excel data<br/>

You must create a conceptual database schema <br/>

You must download and reformat the data to fit a conceptual database schema. (This involves using web
scrapers, web API’s, formatting scripts, parsing files, etc.) <br/>

You must audit the quality and estimate the amount of data you’ll gather. This involves auditing (i.e.
testing to evaluate quality/accuracy - a systematic and independent examination of data). You will need
to audit the following:<br/>
• Audit Validity/ Accuracy<br/>
• Audit Completeness<br/>
• Audit Consistency/Uniformity
