# Topic and Data
My domain on assignment 2 is about NBA data. Part of my data is from last assignment where I requested with nba_api and scraped from Real GM.
Other data is also required for this assignment. Tweets data is acquired with tweepy and I also downloaded about 10,000 entries of NBA game details
about all 30 teams since 1983.

# Project Report
In this part I will explain the details about the project according to all the bullet points given by professor.

#### Part 1 Conceptual Stage

- **A domain**<br/>
  This project is about NBA.

- **Conceptual models (entities) for a tweet/post, a Social Media user, a person, and a company.** <br/>
  The plan on tweet entities is separate tweets into three entities regarding to the consumers, producers and companies that will mentioned in the next point.<br/>
  Each entities will have a same model. Attributes should include import information such as id, tweets, time, likes count, and hashtags etc.<br/>

  For social media user, the entities will only contain information like their id, user name and screen name(@id for twitter). This is because there
  will be less than 100 entries for these entities due to the request limit on my twitter developer account.<br/>

  Players ,considered as person , will have attributes such as date of birth, position, weight, height, draft year and in game stats for this entity.<br/>
  NBA teams are considered as companies in this case where the attributes are founded date, nick name, location and abbreviation.<br/>
  All the entries will have a ID that is unique within its entity.

- **Conceptual models (entities) that represent consumers, producers and companies in your chosen domain.** <br/>
  The companies in my case is 30 NBA teams. The producers are the 20 selected NBA super stars that are know very active on twitter.<br/>
  Consumers have two main parts, fans and NBA media. They will be spreading or retweeting the news and tweets generated by NBA teams and players.

- **Conceptual models (entities) for at least two things specific to the domain.**<br/>
  For this part, my database will contain entities such as all-star games, regular season games, pre season games and post season games.

- **Relationships that connect the entities.**<br/>

    Shown as below.

- **Appropriate attributes and keys.**

    Shown as below.

- **ER diagrams that illustrate the entire conceptual model.**<br/>
  Most entities have a one to one relationship where a few have 0 to 1 or many to many relationship. <br/>
  Primary keys for most entities is a unique ID that are pre generated when acquiring the data. These IDs are verified to be unique during the data auditing process.<br/>
  Some entities such as web scraped data was assigned a unique value as primary key manually.
  NBA games and all-star roaster by team is one exception where combination of two id is used as the primary key.<br/>
  Details of relation, attributes and keys can be found in ER diagram.

- **7 questions**<br/>

    1. *What are the ranges, data types and format of all of the attributes in your entities?*<br/>
        The details of this question can be found in the ER diagram. All the attributes that contain string are designed as text such as name, tweet and location. Where ranges can vary. 
        However, during the building process, some of the strings such as abbreviation for different team is set to VARCHAR(4) since the characters in an abbreviation is no longer than 3. 
        In this case, a sort based on this attribute will become much faster compare to text type. Details of changes will be presented in the ER diagram on physical database model.<br/>
        Numerical values are mostly integer such as block, points, player id and retweet count. The range for play stats are mostly non-negative value that smaller that 100. 
        Where player id can as large as million. One exception is for twitter account id, some of the number is so large that double is needed. 
        Double is also used for attributes like shooting percentage where the range is from 0 to 1.<br/>
        Date and time is used when their is date involved such as date of an all-star game where the earliest date can be around 1950s.

    2. *When should you use an entity versus attribute? (Example: address of a person could be
        modeled as either)*<br/>
        Entities do have a key attribute are considered as weak entities. That's when it should be split into attributes.
        For my case tweet account for each NBA teams do not have a strong relationship since the team entity is trying to have relation with games and players.
        I decide the put them into a separate entity where twitter account information for all parties are stored.

    3. *When should you use an entity or relationship, and placement of attributes? (Example: a
        manager could be modeled as either)*<br/>
        When the attributes can have relation with in them where a relational entities can explain it easier.
        Another case is when multiple information is stored in one cell. For example, hashtags for tweets, it is very difficult to deal with.
        This is why I choose to build a entity for hashtags which have a one to many relationship with the entity for tweets.

    4. *How did you choose your keys? Which are unique?*<br/>
        Primary keys for most entities is a unique ID that are pre generated when acquiring the data. These IDs are verified to be unique during the data auditing process.
        Some entities such as web scraped data was assigned a unique value as primary key manually.

    5. *Did you model hierarchies using the ‚ÄúISA‚Äù design element? Why or why not?*<br/>
        Yes, but only for all-star players. That is the only place where an all-star player is a nba player.
        There are only is in relationships for other part of my database such as hashtags is in tweets. player is in draft history  etc.

    6. *Were there design alternatives? What are their trade-offs: entity vs. attribute, entity vs.
        relationship, binary vs. ternary relationships?*<br/>

        The original design is to use record id instead of combination of two values as primary key for all-star roaster. 
        This way it will consume more space from server and query some extra data that is not useful.

        Twitter account and tweets for NBA team, plyer and team was originally designed to be stored <br/>separately due to the structure of my raw data. 
        However, they were combined into two entities where one stored all the twitter account and the other one stored tweets.<br/>

        Hashtags was stored as a list along side with tweets. However, during the query of counting hashtags, the lack of ability to handle string for MySQL made it very difficult. 
        I then switched to a new design where hashtags are store in an independent entity where the tweet id is the foreign key. 

    7. *Where are you going to find real-world data to populate your model?*<br/>
        Part of my data is from last assignment where I requested with nba_api and scraped from Real GM.<br/>
        Other data is also required for this assignment. Tweets data is acquired with tweepy and I also downloaded about 10,000 entries of NBA game details about all 30 teams since 1983.

#### Part 2 Physical Stage

- **Updated ER diagrams that illustrate the entire conceptual model in a form that directly maps to SQL.** <br/>
  The ER diagram is updated after building the physical model. Some relationships are refined and entities are expanded.Details can be found in the final ERD.

- **SQL and diagram for the physical model that represents the entire conceptual/physical model.**<br/>
  The SQL and diagrams are located in the database folder.

- **SQL that express the queries you are asked to write. Including:**<br/>
    a. What user posted this (e.g. tweet, Facebook post, IG post, etc.)?<br/>
    This can be find by using the script such as

    ```mysql
    -- Looking for exact tweet(s) made by nba teams
    -- Return USER_NAME
    SELECT USER_NAME FROM tweets
      WHERE TWEET = "Clear the runway for @Double0AG üõ´ https://t.co/MRbdVVGFRi"
             AND TYPE = "team";
    ```
    This will return something like this:

    | USER_NAME     |
    | :-----: |
    | Orlando Magic |

    ```mysql
    -- Looking for tweet made by nba teams with similar pattern
    -- Return USER_NAME
    SELECT USER_NAME FROM tweets
      WHERE TYPE = "team"
     		AND TWEET like "Clear the runway for %" ;
    ```
    This will return something like this:

    | USER_NAME            |
    | :-----: |
    | Orlando Magic        |
    | Orlando Magic        |
    | Orlando Magic        |
    | Los Angeles Lakers   |

    b. When did the user post this (e.g. tweet, facebook post, IG post, etc.)?\
    ```mysql
    -- Looking for tweets with pattern made by nba teams
    -- Return CREATED_AT
    SELECT CREATED_AT FROM tweets
      WHERE TYPE = "team" AND TWEET like "Clear the runway for %";
    ```
    This will return something like this:

    |      CREATED_AT     |
    | :-----: |
    | 2018-01-19 00:35:11 |
    | 2018-02-07 02:02:44 |
    | 2018-11-08 00:18:56 |
    | 2018-12-11 04:41:23 |
    ```mysql
    -- Looking for tweets with pattern made by nba teams
    -- Return year, month, day, hour, minue and second found in CREATED_AT 
    SELECT YEAR(CREATED_AT),MONTH(CREATED_AT),DAY(CREATED_AT),HOUR(CREATED_AT),MINUTE(CREATED_AT), SECOND(CREATED_AT)
      FROM tweets
      WHERE TYPE = "team" AND TWEET like "Clear the runway for %";
    ```
    This will return something like this:

    |YEAR(CREATED_AT)| MONTH(CREATED_AT)| DAY(CREATED_AT)| HOUR(CREATED_AT)| MINUTE(CREATED_AT)|  SECOND(CREATED_AT) |
    | :-----: |:-----: |:-----: |:-----: |:-----: |:-----: |
    | 2018 | 1 | 19 | 0 | 35 | 11 |
    | 2018 | 2 | 7 | 2 | 2 | 44 |
    | 2018 | 11 | 8 | 0 | 18 | 56 |
    | 2018 | 12 | 11 | 4 | 41 | 23 |

    c. What posts has this user posted in the past 24 hours?\
    Since the post in our data base are not live, I need to find the newest post in the data base.
    ```mysql
    -- Find tweets send most recently by nba teams. Limited to 10 entries.
    -- Return 10 records of details
    SELECT CREATED_AT,TWEET,USER_NAME FROM tweets
        WHERE TYPE = "team"
    	ORDER BY CREATED_AT DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```
    Query result:

    Now I'm choosing New Orleans Pelicans as my targeted user.  
    ```mysql
    -- Find tweets by New Orleans Pelicans in 24 hours
    -- Return time, tweets etc.
    SELECT CREATED_AT, TWEET, USER_NAME, RETWEET_COUNT, FAVORITE_COUNT, HASHTAGS

      */
      WHERE (CREATED_AT
                >= (SELECT DATE_SUB((
                  SELECT MAX(CREATED_AT)
                  FROM tweets_team

    d. How many post has this user posted in the past 24 hours?\
    For this question, selecting tweet from last 24 hour by pelicans can be reused. Just use count method to get the total numbers.

     ```mysql
    -- look for the amount of tweets by New Orleans Pelicans
    -- Return total amount
    SELECT COUNT(*), USER_NAME
      FROM tweets_team
      WHERE (CREATED_AT
                >= (SELECT DATE_SUB((
                  SELECT MAX(CREATED_AT)
                  FROM tweets_team
                  WHERE USER_NAME = "New Orleans Pelicans")
                  ,INTERVAL 24 HOUR))
               AND USER_NAME = "New Orleans Pelicans")
      GROUP BY USER_NAME;
     ```
    Query result:

    | TWEET | USER_NAME |
    | :-----: |:-----: |
    | 9 |  New Orleans Pelicans |

    e. What keywords/ hashtags are popular?\

    ```mysql
    -- Look for amount of all hashtage with descending order
    -- Return count of 10 most popular hastags
    SELECT COUNT(*), HASHTAG FROM hashtags
    GROUP BY HASHTAG
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

    Query result:

    | COUNT(*) | HASHTAGS |
    | :------: | :--------: |
    |4766 | NBA|
    |4729 | Rockets|
    |4037 | NBAAllStar|
    |3318 | HereTheyCome|
    |3132 | MileHighBasketball|
    |2973 | TrueToAtlanta|
    |2956 | WhyNot|
    |2883 | FearTheDeer|
    |2822 | LakeShow|
    |2728 | DubNation|

    The result shows that #NBA is the most popular hashtag where #Rockets and #NBAAllStar is some most recent popular hashtags.

    f. What posts are popular?

    ```mysql
    -- Show tweets with popularity where popularity is defined with like and retweet
    -- Return Tweet and like, retweey count in descending order
    SELECT CREATED_AT AS TIME, TWEET, USER_NAME AS USER, FAVORITE_COUNT AS FAV, RETWEET_COUNT AS RETWET
    FROM tweets ORDER BY RETWEET_COUNT
    DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```
    Query result:

    From this result we can see that order by retweet results in some high retweet count with 0 favorite. This means that all these tweet are retweet by the players or fans.

    We are going to do another query order by fav.

    ```mysql
    -- Show tweets with popularity where popularity is defined with like and retweet
    -- Return Tweet and like, retweey count in descending order
    SELECT CREATED_AT AS TIME, TWEET, USER_NAME AS USER, FAVORITE_COUNT AS FAV, RETWEET_COUNT AS RETWET
    FROM tweets ORDER BY FAVORITE_COUNT
    DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```
    Query result:

    From the result we can see that LeBron James is one of the most popular player on twitter where his tweet about white house is the most popular tweet in my database.
- At least 5 (10 if two people) distinct use cases of queries that are particular to your domain.<br/>
The following five use cases are designed for this assignment
1. Find the most accurate three pointer shooter after 1995 where the person need has at least 100 attempts.
2. Find players had most all-star appearances.
3. Find team with most wins since 1983
4. Find the most active player on twitter with their popularity.
5. Find what hashtag each nba player uses most frequently.

- SQL expressions that express the 5 (10 if two people) use cases of queries that you write.<br/>
1. Find the most accurate three pointer shooter after 1995 where the person need has at least 100 attempts.<br/>

    The first query shows that active players do not varies too much in terms of quantities. Stephen Curry tweeted most tweets where the top 5 active players have about the same amount of tweets.
    Order the players by average likes they get on their each tweet. It's not difficult to spot that LeBron James is the most popular player among all the player in my database.

5. Find what hashtag each nba player uses most frequently.
	```mysql
    -- Create view for each hashtag frequency by username
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW hashtag_frequency AS
    SELECT HASHTAG,t.USER_NAME,MAX(t.TYPE) TYPE,COUNT(*) times  FROM hashtags
      LEFT JOIN tweets t on hashtags.TWEET_ID = t.TWEET_ID
    GROUP BY HASHTAG,USER_NAME;
    -- Show first 10 rows of view
    SELECT* FROM hashtag_frequency LIMIT 10;
	```
    Query result:
    
    | HASHTAG              | USER_NAME       | TYPE | times |
    | :---: |:---: |:---: |:---: |
    | WeTheNorth           | Toronto Raptors | team |  1623 |
    | NBAAllStar           | Toronto Raptors | team |   106 |
    | KawhiLeonard         | Toronto Raptors | team |    25 |
    | OGSeason7            | Toronto Raptors | team |    36 |
    | ThisIsWhyWePlay      | Toronto Raptors | team |    35 |
    | MtnDew3PT            | Toronto Raptors | team |    17 |
    | StateFarmSaturday    | Toronto Raptors | team |     2 |
    | KyleLowry            | Toronto Raptors | team |    24 |
    | TeamGiannis          | Toronto Raptors | team |     2 |
    | MTNDEWICERisingStars | Toronto Raptors | team |     6 |
    
    Now find the most frequent hashtag for each player
    ```mysql
    -- Show max frequency of hashtags for each player
    SELECT maxfre.USER_NAME,hf.HASHTAG, maxfre.times FROM hashtag_frequency hf
      INNER JOIN (
          -- Find max appearance for each player
          SELECT USER_NAME, MAX(times) times FROM hashtag_frequency hf WHERE TYPE = 'player'GROUP BY USER_NAME) maxfre
        ON (hf.times=maxfre.times AND hf.USER_NAME = maxfre.USER_NAME)
    ORDER BY hf.times DESC;
    ```
    Query result:
    
    | USER_NAME             | HASHTAG            | times |
    | :---:|  :---:|  :---:| 
    | Russell Westbrook     | whynot             |  2655 |
    | Stephen Curry         | DubNation          |   816 |
    | LeBron James          | Striveforgreatness |   786 |
    | James Harden          | ThunderUp          |   564 |
    | Luka Doncic           | halamadrid         |   507 |
    | Jayson Tatum          | Duke               |   393 |
    | Joel Embiid           | kubball            |   288 |
    | Gordon Hayward        | improveeveryday    |   287 |
    | Carmelo Anthony       | STAYME7O           |   270 |
    | Paul George           | PacerNation        |   246 |
    | Kevin Durant          | KDIV               |   181 |
    | DWade                 | OneLastDance       |   154 |
    | Paul Pierce           | FitClub34          |   145 |
    | Kyrie Irving          | UncleDrew          |   113 |
    | Jaylen Brown          | pause              |   106 |
    | Chris Paul            | TeamCP3            |    92 |
    | Kobe Bryant           | MambaMentality     |    73 |
    | klay thompson         | Dubnation          |    61 |
    | Giannis Antetokounmpo | NBAVote            |    49 |
    | Derrick Rose          | TheReturn          |    34 |
    
    From the query result we can tell Russell Westbrook has the highest frequency of a hashtag named 'whynot'. This should be his signature shoes' name. 
    This happened to other players as well. For example, 'DubNation' is a nick name for his team where 'TEAMCP3' is Chris Paul's brand. Seems famous players tend to present their brand or team most often.
